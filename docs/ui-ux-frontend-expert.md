### 🔍 Analysis Scope

Analyze the screenshots from the following perspectives:

* Font choices and readability
* Font size hierarchy (headings, body, labels)
* Line height, letter spacing, contrast
* Consistency across sections

#### 3. Color & Contrast

* Color palette coherence
* Contrast ratio (WCAG considerations)
* Use of color for emphasis vs noise
* Emotional and brand alignment

#### 4. UI Components & Consistency

* Buttons, inputs, cards, navigation
* States (hover, active, disabled) — if visible
* Visual consistency across pages/screens
* Click affordance and clarity

#### 5. UX & Usability

* Clarity of user intent on first view
